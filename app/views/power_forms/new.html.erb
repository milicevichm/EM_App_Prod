          Welcome to the home page of the <b><i>Energy Management through Power Disaggregation</i></b> design project.
          This web application will run a disaggregation algorithm on the total power usage measurements of
          a real residential building, <a href="http://redd.csail.mit.edu/">whose dataset is provided from researchers at MIT</a>.
          This disaggregation will estimate the total power used by the selected household appliance, giving an accurate representation of
          individual power consumption without the need to connect a physical sub-meter to the system.

          <br>
          <br>

          To get started, please select your disaggregation parameters
          using the form below. For more information about the project motivation and team please visit our
          <a href="ecse-457.ece.mcgill.ca/static_pages/about" > about page</a>. The disaggregation algorithms and processing
          used in this project are powered through the <a href="http://nilmtk.github.io/">Non-Intrusive Load-Monitoring Toolkit (NILMTK) </a>,
          an open source Python framework that utilizes machine-learning to find the best possible disaggregation results.

              To begin please select the appliance of which you wish to see the disaggregated power usage signal. As
              the system is using a static dataset, please only choose date and time ranges of between
